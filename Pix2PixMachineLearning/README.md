This was an example python script utilized as a part of a bigger research project at Max Planck Florida Institute that worked with a variety of other python scripts
I created in order to utilize Pix2Pix to process a large amount of data and train a machine learning algorithm. It demonstrates Python knowledge, usage of other libraries
(ImageMagick initially, later updated to use imageio), image processing, machine learning, and big data processing.
