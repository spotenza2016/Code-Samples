This was a C++ project to recreate minesweeper using SFML, which was heavily bug tested to search for memory leaks and then packaged into a static exe file that can be
provided upon request. It demonstrates C++ knowledge, memory management, object orientated programming, utilization of other libraries (SFML), and the ability to recreate
existing projects with my own methods.
