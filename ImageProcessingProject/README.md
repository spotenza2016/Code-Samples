This was a school project where we were required to take in a variety of images, and be able to use the file binary to store the images, and run a variety of image
processing such as color adjustments, rotations, subtractions, etc. It demonstrates C++ knowledge, object orientated programming, binary file processing, image processing,
and self evaluation of test cases.
