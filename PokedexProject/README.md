This was a java school project that aimed to simulate a "Pokedex" (renamed "Pakuridex") from the show and game series "Pokemon". It would utilize object orientated
programming to create a Pakuridex, that would store a variety of statistics on the Pakuri stored inside. It is essentially just practice of object orientated concepts
and working with classes to create clean, understandable connections between them (ie a Pakuridex contains a list of Pakuri).
